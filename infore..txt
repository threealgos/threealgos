Execution on Quantum Hardware:
This code can be executed on IBM's quantum computers by changing the backend to a real quantum device (e.g., IBMQ.get_backend('ibmq_16_melbourne')).
Ensure you have access to IBM Quantum services and have set up your API token to run the code on actual hardware.
Note:
The code generates random Bitcoin private keys and checks if the corresponding address matches a specified target. The process is inherently probabilistic, and finding a matching address may take a significant amount of time, depending on the randomness and the target address.
